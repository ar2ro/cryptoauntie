<p>
	MetaMask offers the easiest way to create an Ethereum wallet. It's considered very safe and it also offers a way to manage your wallet directly on your browser. 
</p>
<p class="quote">
	Some Ethereum apps and exchanges even require you to have the MetaMask extension installed on your browser.
</p>
<p>
	To start MetaMask, make sure you visit the official website https://metamask.io/ and from there, select your browser to install the extension, in this tutorial we'll be using Google Chrome so we click in the "GET CHROME EXTENSION" button.
</p>
<p class="text-center">

</p>
<p>
	Then we must click the "ADD TO CHROME" button in the Chrome Web Store.
</p>
<p class="text-center">
	<img class="bordered img-fluid" src="/assets/images/posts/metamask/add-to-chrome.jpg" alt="MetaMask add to chrome button">
</p>
<p>
	Once the extension is installed we should see a new icon in our browser bar, also a new page should open where we can see an introductory video about how MetaMask works.
</p>
<p class="text-center">
	<img class="bordered img-fluid" src="/assets/images/posts/metamask/installed.jpg" alt="MetaMask installed correctly">
</p>
<p>
	If we click the newly added icon in our browser bar we first should see an announcement asking us to try a new version of MetaMask, we will click the "TRY IT NOW" button which should open a welcome page
</p>
<p class="text-center">
	<img class="bordered img-fluid" src="/assets/images/posts/metamask/announcement.jpg" alt="MetaMask try beta version" style="max-width: 45%; vertical-align: top">
	<img class="bordered img-fluid" src="/assets/images/posts/metamask/welcome.jpg" alt="MetaMask welcome page" style="max-width: 45%; vertical-align: top">
</p>
<p>
	By clicking "CONTINUE" we should be prompted to create a password, then a custom image is generated for our account, and finally, we must accept the Terms of Use, to any other notice you should just click "ACCEPT"
</p>
<p class="text-center">
	<img class="bordered img-fluid" src="/assets/images/posts/metamask/password-image-terms.jpg" alt="MetaMask create password, generate image and accept terms">
</p>
<p>
	Then a new Secret Backup Phrase will be generated, (you must click to reveal), this is a 12-word secret phrase which you should store in a safe place as you can't recover this.
</p>
<p class="text-center">
	<img class="bordered img-fluid" src="/assets/images/posts/metamask/phrase.jpg" alt="MetaMask generate secret phrase">
</p>
<p>
	Then you have to confirm your generated phrase by selecting each word in the exact same position they appear on your phrase
</p>
<p class="text-center">
	<img class="bordered img-fluid" src="/assets/images/posts/metamask/confirm-phrase.jpg" alt="MetaMask phrase confirmation">
</p>
<p>
	Once confirmed, we're done, we should now see our wallet and by clicking the "DETAILS" button our wallet address should be displayed
</p>
<p class="text-center">
	<img class="bordered img-fluid" src="/assets/images/posts/metamask/show-address.jpg" alt="MetaMask show address">
</p>
<p>
That long string, starting with 0xf.... is what we need to send each time we're asked for our ERC20 compatible address. By clicking "VIEW ACCOUNT ON ETHERSCAN" we'll be redirected to http://etherscan.io/ where we can see the public info for our wallet including our balances and transaction history.

Finally by clicking "EXPORT PRIVATE KEY" we'll be able to download our private key (used to make transfers) which we must store in a safe place.
