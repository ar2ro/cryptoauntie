		If you're unfamiliar with cryptocurrencies you might think of an airdrop as the act of dropping supplies, troops, or equipment by parachute from an aircraft. However, in the world of cryptocurrencies, airdrops mean something else.
	</p>
	<p>
		<img src="/assets/images/posts/airdrops/airdrop.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="supplies being airdropped from plane">
	</p>
	<p>
		A cryptocurrency airdrop is a process whereby a blockchain-based startup, and even well-established enterprises, distributes cryptocurrency tokens to a group of users free of charge in order to bootstrap their cryptocurrency projects. Airdrops can be compared to free samples in the mall, but instead of physical goods, small amounts of cryptocurrencies are "dropped" into user's wallets.
	</p>
	
	<h2>Are Airdrops really free money?</h2>

	<p>
		As the saying goes, <q><i>There's no such thing as a free lunch</i></q>, and this also applies in the world of cryptocurrencies. So how can Airdrops be "free"? you could ask.
	</p>
	<p>
		Although you won't need to invest any money to participate in an Airdrop, you're required to perform some tasks in order to be eligible for an Airdrop.
	</p>
	<p>
		There are some main reasons blockchain-enabled projects perform Airdrops, like creating a community around the project, lead generation, and raise awareness. To achieve this they set aside a part of their tokens to be freely distributed between the users who help them towards this mean.
	</p>
	
	<h2>How beneficial is for a project to perform an Airdrop?</h2>
	
	<p>
		You may be asking how beneficial is for a project to give away their tokens for free so a good example of this is the Bitcoin Cash Airdrop. 
		For every Bitcoin held by a Bitcoin Cash participant, the developers gave a corresponding amount of Bitcoin Cash. The end result was that in less than one month, Bitcoin Cash was among one of the top 10 cryptocurrencies in the market.
		So given that one of the main factors defining a cryptocurrency value is its network size, yes, an Airdrop can make the difference between a successful and a failed project.
	</p>
		
	<h2>Common tasks required to participate in an Airdrop:</h2>
	
	<p>
		In the end, the main objective for Airdroppers is to grow its community and project awareness through social media engagement, and they need you for that, so the most common tasks they'll ask you to do in order to give you tokens are: 
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Follow a Twitter account.</li>
		<li>Like a Facebook page.</li>
		<li>Share posts or retweet some project related info.</li>
		<li>Join a Telegram channel.</li>
		<li>Subscribe to a newsletter.</li>
		<li>Vote for exchange listing.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>
		A more advanced form of Airdrop, often called Bounty, will require some more advanced tasks, like publishing posts, include digital signatures in your profiles etc. Generally, these Bounties distribute a larger amount of tokens to qualified users.
	</p>

	<h2>How much can I earn participating in Airdrops?</h2>

	<p>
		The amount someone can earn by participating in Airdrops is highly variable, while you can get hundreds of dollars from some Airdrops you will get from $2 to $10 from others, in some other cases the projects will fail or their tokens won't ever gain the expected value so your received tokens won't be of any worth. Here are some examples of successful Airdrops:
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Decred(DCR)</b> distributed 282DCR tokens to each Airdrop participant, with the current value of DCR being $44.12 having participated in this Airdrop would have yield you +$12,400.
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Ontology(ONT)</b> airdropped 1,000 ONT tokens to everyone who subscribed to their newsletter, with a current value of $1.87, this one would have yield you about $2,000.
	</p>
	<p>
		There are many other projects which have conducted Airdrops in the past like RaiBlocks and even Ripple.
	</p>
	
	<h2>Commonly needed tools.</h2>

	<p>
		In order to participate in Airdrops there are some commonly required tools you'll need to set up in order to take your cut: 
	</p>

	<dl>
		<dt>An Ethereum Wallet:</dt>
		<dd>
			<p>
				Most of the Airdropped tokens run on top of the Ethereum Blockchain, so you'll need a wallet in order to receive the tokens. This wallet has to be ERC20 compatible, so exchange wallets won't work. The best options to get your wallet are MetaMask and MyEtherWallet. You can follow the <a href="#">How to create an Ethereum wallet on MyEtherWallet and connect it to MetaMask</a> tutorial if you don't know how to do so.
			</p>
		</dd>
		<dt>A Telegram Account:</dt>
		<dd>
			<p>
				Most projects will ask you to join their Telegram channel so if you don't currently have a Telegram account you'll need to create one. If you do have a Telegram account, my advice is for you is to create a dedicated account, signing up to multiple channels will eventually turn your account into a mess of chats with thousands of messages arriving at a time. You can add a new account in your current Telegram application, to do so you just have to add a phone number (you don't even have to handle this number on your phone, you just need access to it in order to receive a confirmation message)</a>.
			</p>
		</dd>
		<dt>A Twitter Account:</dt>
		<dd>
			<p>
				Another commonly required task is to follow Twitter accounts and retweet some of their content so a Twitter account is a must.
			</p>
		</dd>
		<dt>An email address:</dt>
		<dd>
			<p>
				With many Airdrops requiring an email signup, it's better to create a new email address, solely designated to handle Airdrops in order to avoid your personal address to be filled with promotional content.
			</p>
		</dd>
		<dt>An exchange account:</dt>
		<dd>
			<p>
				Once you start receiving your Airdrops, you'll need a way to exchange those tokens. Either if you want to preserve its value by buying a more established coin or if you want to exchange it into fiat currency, it's recommended you open an account in at least one or two of the most established exchanges like <a href="https://www.binance.com/?ref=17387281" target="_blank">Binance</a> and <a href="https://www.kucoin.com/#/?r=1f5yg" target="_blank">Kucoin</a> (these two exchanges constantly run Airdrops and Giveaways, and some airdrops may ask you to vote on those exchange to include the a token on the exchange, so its a good idea to open an account in each of them) or another maybe bitshares or something.
			</p>
			<p>
			  If you'll be exchanging your tokens into fiat money, the fastest way is to convert them into Bitcoin in one of the mentioned exchanges, then transferring this balance to <a href="https://localbitcoins.com/?ch=ul9z" target=_blank>LocalBitcoins</a> where you can exchange it for any fiat currency.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Tip:</b> My personal choice is to exchange half of the received tokens into a more established coin like Bitcoin and keep the other half in case of a sudden increase in value.
			</p>
		</dd>
		<dt>A bitcointalk account:</dt>
		<dd>
			Although not commonly required is a good Idea to open an account early on. Some projects require you to have an account with a certain age. It's also a good idea to stay active on the forums as your activity will commonly be tracked in order to determine your eligibility.
		</dd>
	</dl>
	
	<h2>Security measures and things to be aware of.</h2>

	<p class="quote">
		Never share your private keys, and never ever pay or send tokens to any address in order to participate in an Airdrop.
	</p>
	<p>
		The cryptocurrency world is full of scams and Airdrops are not the exception, some shaddy projects will ask you to send a small amount of Ether to a certain address in order to fund the gas needed to transfer your tokens, this is a big no-no and a sign to stay away from that project.
	</p>
	<p>
		You should check official project sources before taking part in any Airdrop, some scammers will try to pose as another project in order to get your data or any other means they might have in mind.
	</p>
	<p>
		Some Airdrops are solely focused on generating a short-term buzz around the project so that people will be eager to buy the token once it hits the exchanges. Once done, the developers quickly sell all their tokens pocketing a juicy profit, and then abandon the project. 
	</p>
	<p>
		An example of this was the Qbic Airdrop, in which participants were given 15 tokens, once the token had hit exchanges, they were sold for as much as $32, the token was effectively dumped reaching a current price of $0.014. Although you'll be solely participating in Airdrops and therefore not losing any money, this is something you should be aware of.
	</p>
		
	<h2>Where to find Airdrops.</h2>
