		Investing in Cryptocurrencies can be highly profitable but it also carries a high risk.
	</p>
	<p>
		Luckily there's a way you can start trading in a simulation without risking a penny, but not only that, you can earn real money prizes based on the behavior of your virtual investments.
	</p>

	<h2 class="header bold">
		Trading in the real world.
	</h2>
	
	<p>
		In order to start making safe investments, or at least with a minified risk, you'll need a lot of tools under your belt, you should at least have a basic knowledge about Technical Analysis, Fundamental Analysis or a combination of both, and both themes are quite broad to get the grasps.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		If you're a newbie, you could start taking a look at <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/university/technical/" target="_blank">Investopedia</a> resources for technical analysis, it will take you a while to get the grasps of the fundamentals but you'll be in the right path. You should then start analyzing historical graphical data and simulating "paper" investments.
	</p>
 	
 	<p>
 		Eventually, you'll be confident enough to start risking your money on real-world trades, and yet you're almost guaranteed to make several loses on your first trades.
 	</p>

	<p class="quote">
		Whatever you do, you should stay away from "advises" from those YouTubers who assure you should buy X coin which is going to the moon and you'll get rich in a year or so. 
	</p>

	<p>
		You see, generally, these guys have already bought those coins at a very low price, then they (and several other people) start talking about and promoting the coins, then a lot of people, usually newbies, start buying those coins rapidly which increases the coin price, this is when those "influencers" can sell their cut for a very nice profit. Large amounts of coins sold usually make the prices crash and then all of those who followed those advises will incur in loses.
	</p>
	
	<p class="quote">
		If you'll be doing this, please instead send your money to me, you'll at least receive a "THANK YOU" letter.
	</p>

	<h2 class="header bold">Get your feet wet in a trading simulation - Compete for real money prizes.</h2>

	<p>
		You can still have a first-hand trading experience without risking a penny of your hard earned money. <a href="https://beta.coinbundle.com/signup?ref=pIuGtzMLIaHObfVXjipHEv3vFRKE3avGc3I4H1jvQMPJHP1WBGY3LlkOxnXGB1OZmREqa3j1AFgKZmVPu5Eisgw0oTWglSy0DzcUz3Ys5lU%3D" target="_blank">CoinBundle</a> is an investment platform which is offering you to test the platform while in beta, for this, they'll provide you with some virtual cash, called <b>Beta$</b> within the platform, you can then use this <b>Beta$</b> to start buying and selling coin bundles. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
		A coin bundle is an asset composed of several coins, with which you effectively diversify your investment portfolio, then reducing your risk. This risk reduction will come in handy later when the platform gets out of its beta stage, as for now, anything you do in it is risk-free as you won't invest any money.
	</p>
	
	<h3 class="header bold">Available bundles:</h3>

	<p>
		<img src="/assets/images/posts/coinbundle/bundles.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="">
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Given the risk-free feature of the <a href="https://beta.coinbundle.com/signup?ref=pIuGtzMLIaHObfVXjipHEv3vFRKE3avGc3I4H1jvQMPJHP1WBGY3LlkOxnXGB1OZmREqa3j1AFgKZmVPu5Eisgw0oTWglSy0DzcUz3Ys5lU%3D" target="_blank">CoinBundle platform</a>, this is an attractive alternative to put in practice your analysis capacities, but this is not really the most attractive feature about CoinBundle.
	</p>

	<h2 class="header bold">Compete against other beta testers for real-money prizes.</h2>

	<p>
		The nicest thing about <a href="https://beta.coinbundle.com/signup?ref=pIuGtzMLIaHObfVXjipHEv3vFRKE3avGc3I4H1jvQMPJHP1WBGY3LlkOxnXGB1OZmREqa3j1AFgKZmVPu5Eisgw0oTWglSy0DzcUz3Ys5lU%3D" target="_blank">CoinBundle</a> is that while trading with artificial money, or <b>Beta$</b>, you'll be competing for real-money prizes, based on your portfolio behavior. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
		The competition is open worldwide and will be held until Oct 20, 2018. Prizes will be paid in the form of cryptocurrencies and are very VERY attractive, with up to 60,000 winning places and the first place walking away with +$140,000. 
	</p>
	
	<h3 class="header bold">First places prizes:</h3>

	<p>
		<img src="/assets/images/posts/coinbundle/prizes.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="">
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Prizes then start decreasing until the 60,000 place which will walk away with  ~$5.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		So this is a great opportunity for newbie and experienced traders alike as everyone will walk away with some free cryptocurrencies without risking a single penny, with the added advantage for beginners to get their first trading experience.
	</p>

	<p>
		You should go on and <a href="https://beta.coinbundle.com/signup?ref=pIuGtzMLIaHObfVXjipHEv3vFRKE3avGc3I4H1jvQMPJHP1WBGY3LlkOxnXGB1OZmREqa3j1AFgKZmVPu5Eisgw0oTWglSy0DzcUz3Ys5lU%3D" target="_blank">register right away</a>, the sooner the better as you will have an advantage over all of those who register before you as you will be receiving free <b>Beta$</b> before them.
